in this series of samples we want to show how use some of the c++ features. So heare are some information about each sample.

* In callback.cpp we use std::function and std::bind to bind some member functions in to another class and then call them in some place of that class.
* In datareader.cpp we use std:function and std::bind to demonstrate how read stream data from a source asynchronously.
* In datareader_lambda.cpp we just use lamda insted of using function member.

Data Structures implimentation in C++

Author Over-Infinity

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively by applications. in this repository we try to implement basic data structures in C++ language.

Basic data structures include:

* Array, Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. 
* Stack, A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. The order is Last In First Out (LIFO).
* Queue, A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
* [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
* Graph
* Hash Table

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively by applications. in this repository we try to implement basic data structures in C++ language.

<h2>Basic data structures include </h2>

<h3>-Array </h3> 
 <b>Array</b> is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. 
<h3>-Link List</h3> <b>Linked List </b> is a very commonly used linear data structure which consists of group of nodes in a sequence.
<h3>-Stack</h3> A <b>stack</b> is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. The order is Last In First Out (LIFO).
<h3>-Queue</h3> A <b>Queue</b> is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
<h3>-Tree</h3> A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children generally referred as left child and right child.
<h3>-Graph</h3>
<h3>-Hash Table</h3>
